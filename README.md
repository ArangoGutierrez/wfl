# wfl - A Simple and Pluggable Workflow Language for Go

_Don't mix wfl with [WFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Flow_Language)._

Creating process, container, pod, task, or job workflows based on raw interfaces of
operating systems, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, and HPC job schedulers can be
a tedios. Lots of repeating code is required. All workload management systems have a
different API.

_wfl_ abstracts away from the underlying details of the processes, containers, and 
workload management systems. _wfl_ provides a simple, unified interface which allows
to quickly define and execute a job workflow and changed between different execution
backends without changing the workflow.

_wfl_ does not come with many features but is be simple to use and enough to define and
run jobs with dependencies.

In its simplest form a process can be started and waited for:

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).Run("convert", "image.jpg", "image.png").Wait()
```

_wfl_ aims to work for any kind of workloads. It works on a Mac and Raspberry Pi the same way
as on a high-performance compute cluster. Things missing: On small scale you probably miss data
management - moving results from one job to another. That's deliberately not implemented.
On large scale you are missing checkpoint and restart functionality or HA of the workflow 
process itself.

I created it for writing simple test applications against the underlying
[Go drmaa2os lib](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2os) which is still work-in-progress
(another free-time project) but I think it is useful also for many other cases.

[Go drmaa2os lib](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2os) is also responsible for lots of
the functionality (especially evaluating JobTemplate). So please contribute or open
an issue over there.

_wfl_ works with simple primitives: *context*, *workflow*, *job*, and *jobtemplate*

## Context

A context defines the execution backend for the workflow. Contexts can be easily created
with the _New_ functions which are defined in the _context.go_ file.

For creating a context which executes the jobs of a workflow in operating system processses use:

```go
    wfl.NewProcessContext()
```

If the workflow needs to be executed in containers the _DockerContext_ can be used: 

```go
    wfl.NewDockerContext("golang:latest", "tmp.db")
```

The first parameter is the name of the default Docker image used when not specified in
_JobTemplate_ as _JobCategory_. The second parameter is the name of the DB file which 
keeps the jobs persistent.

When you want to run the workflow as Cloud Foundry Tasks the _CloudFoundryContext_ can be used:

```go
    wfl.NewCloudFoundryContext("addressOfAPI", "username", "password", "tmp.db")
```

Contexts for other workload managers like Kubernetes, DRMAA compatible HPC schedulers,
etc. will be supported when the DRMAA2 job tracker implementation is available.

## Workflow

A workflow encapsulates a set of jobs using the same backend (context).
It can be created by using:

```go
    wf := wfl.NewWorkflow(ctx)
```

Errors during creation can be catched with

```go
    wf := wfl.NewWorkflow(ctx).OnError(func(e error) {panic(e)})
```

or with

```go
    if wf.HasError() {
        panic(wf.Error())
    }
```

## Job

Jobs are the main objects in _wfl_. A job defines helper methods. Many of them return the job object itself to allow chaining  calls in an easy way.

Methods can be classified in blocking, non-blocking, job template based, function based, and error handlers.

Job submission:

* Run()
* RunT()
* Resubmit()

Job control:

* Suspend()
* Resume()
* Kill()

Function execution:

* Do()
* Then()
* OnSuccess()
* OnFailure()
* OnError()

Blocker:

* After()
* Wait()
* Synchronize()

Job flow control:

* ThenRun() // wait() + run()
* ThenRunT()
* OnSuccessRun() // wait() + success() + run()
* OnFailureRun()
* Retry() // wait() + !success() + resubmit() + wait() + !success() ...
* OneFailed() // checks if one of the jobs in flow failed

Job status and general checks:

* Template() 
* State()
* LastError()
* Failed()
* Success()
* ExitStatus()

## JobTemplate

JobTemplates are specifying the details about a job. In the simplest case the job is specified by the application name and its arguments like it is typically done in the OS shell. In that case the _Run()_ methods (_ThenRun()_, _OnSuccessRun()_, _OnFailureRun()_) can be used. If more details for specifying the jobs are required the _RunT()_ methods needs to be used.
I'm using currently the [DRMAA2 Go JobTemplate](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2interface/blob/master/jobtemplate.go)
as parameters for them. In most cases only _RemoteCommand_, _Args_, _WorkingDirectory_, _JobCategory_, _JobEnvironment_,  _StageInFiles_ are evaluated. Functionality and semantic is up to the underlying [drmaa2os job tracker](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2os/tree/master/pkg/jobtracker).

- [For the Docker mapping here](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2os/tree/master/pkg/jobtracker/dockertracker)
- [For the Cloud Foundry Task mapping here](https://github.com/dgruber/drmaa2os/blob/master/pkg/jobtracker/cftracker)

The [_Template_](https://github.com/dgruber/wfl/blob/master/template.go) object provides helper functions for job templates. It is likely to completely switch to such an abstraction later. For an example see [here](https://github.com/dgruber/wfl/tree/master/examples/template/template.go).

# Examples

For examples please have a look into the examples directory. [template](https://github.com/dgruber/wfl/tree/master/examples/template/template.go) is a canonical example of a pre-processing job, followed by parallel execution, followed by a post-processing job.

[test](https://github.com/dgruber/wfl/blob/master/test/test.go) is an use case for testing. It compiles
all examples with the local go compiler and then within a Docker container using the _golang:latest_ image
and reports errors.

[cloudfoundry](https://github.com/dgruber/wfl/blob/master/examples/cloudfoundry/cloudfoundry.go) demonstrates how a Cloud Foundry taks can be created.


## Creating a Workflow which is Executed in OS Processes

The allocated context defines which workload management system / job execution backend is used.

```go
    ctx := wfl.NewProcessContext()
```

Different contexts can be used within a single program. That way multi-clustering potentially
over different cloud solutions is supported.

Using a context a workflow can be established.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext())
```

Handling an error during workflow generation can be done by specifying a function which 
is only called in the case of an error.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).OnError(func(e error) {
		panic(e)
	})
```

The workflow is used in order to instantiate the first job using the _Run()_ method.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).Run("sleep", "123")
```

But you can also create an initial job like that:

```go
    job := wfl.NewJob(wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()))
```

For more detailed settings (like resource limits) the DRMAA2 job template can be used as parameter for _RunT()_.

Jobs allow the execution of workload as well as expressing dependencies.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).Run("sleep", "2").ThenRun("sleep", "1").Wait()
```

The line above executes two OS processes sequentially and waits until the last job in chain is finished.

In the following example the two sleep processes are executed in parallel. _Wait()_ only waitf for the sleep 1 job. Hence sleep 2 still runs after the wait call comes back.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).Run("sleep", "2").Run("sleep", "1").Wait()
```

Running two jobs in parallel and waiting until all jobs finished can be done _Synchronize()_.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(wfl.NewProcessContext()).Run("sleep", "2").Run("sleep", "1").Synchronize()
```

Jobs can also be suspended (stopped) and resumed (continued) - if supported by the execution backend (like OS, Docker).

```go
    wf.Run("sleep", "1").After(time.Millisecond * 100).Suspend().After(time.Millisecond * 100).Resume().Wait()
```

The exit status is available as well. _ExitStatus()_ blocks until the previously submitted job is finished.

```go
    wfl.NewWorkflow(ctx).Run("echo", "hello").ExitStatus()
```

In order to run jobs depending on the exit status the _OnFailure_ and _OnSuccess_ methods can be used:

```go
	wf.Run("false").OnFailureRun("true").OnSuccessRun("false")
```

For executing a function on a submission error _OnError()_ can be used.

More methods can be found in the sources.
